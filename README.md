### 👨‍🎓 About Me 👨‍🎓
I'm a student in ESCOM, despite my great fascination with electronics, in recent years I have dedicated much of my time to specialize in Data, from DB management, exploratory analysis, predictions models, Machine Learning models, I have even made image analysis for disease detection and emotion classification.

I'm a great computer enthusiast, I've been in academic excellence for two and a half years, and I have a Santander scholarship in Data Science.

My countries besides computers are motorsport, I am a big fan of Formula 1, I also like to cook and collect cacti.
